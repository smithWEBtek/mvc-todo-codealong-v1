Online learning provides the quality of material that Flatiron produces, the community of Learners and the periodic coaching / assessments and job placement help without the cost or tight schedule of onsite/immersion. 

Ideally learning a craft would have the apprentice getting 1 on 1 help from the master.  I have found that the videos of Avi coding are my best experience beyond the work of researching and completing labs. Especially after I have struggled to do something on my own, the answers in the videos then come to life and the understanding deepens.

So, the improvement I would suggest is to keep making videos with the idea to code along, AFTER the student has gone through the related labs. I would organize the material some appropriate work order, and encourage the student to pause and attempt to code the next piece on their own, before seeing it in the video.

For example, I have found the TODO-MVC series to be very helpful in tying together my understanding of Rails to that point. I try to figure out what Avi is going to code next, then I stop the video to build it myself first.  It allows me to explore ideas without getting too discouraged, because the video will keep me on track. The answers take on a deeper meaning after I've tried to do it on my own, and the experimentation can help build the troubleshooting / debugging skills that will be needed in a real job.
